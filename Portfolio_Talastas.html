					<h3> Paris, a popular city and the capital of France, is one of the places 
					that I really want to go because it has mesmerizing buildings. 
					One of the main reasons for wanting to go there is to take pictures 
					of the famous Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and more of the cultural city. 
					Another reason is the charm of the caf√©s that serve delectable croissants. 
					Going to this city has always been a dream! </h3>

					<h3> Palawan's beauty has always been top-tier, and for me, it is one of the best 
					places to go here in the Philippines. It is well-known for its white sand beaches 
					and islands, as well as its clear blue water, and as a nature lover, this makes me 
					want to live near such beauty. This place is too good to be true, especially since 
					it is part of the Philippine waters. I also want to go here because it just feels 
					like you're in a magical world with a lot to offer.</h3>

					<h3> As a former K-drama and K-pop fan, I've always admired the culture of this country.
					Everything in this country is highly progressive, and the convenience store there is 
					just my favorite because of the yummy food it sells. Another thing is its climate and 
					the view of this country, because it looks so surreal. I can't really express more about 
					South Korea, but this country is special to me, and I think a great way to go there is to 
					start with Seoul, the capital city!</h3>

					<h3> A great example of a picturesque city that has a great story to tell is
					Venice in Italy. It has one of the most unique environments because it's a city 
					built on water. This city's architecture is so beautiful that you want to 
					photograph almost everything. There are also some spectacular bridges here, 
					and I want to experience a tour ride in this charming place.</h3>

					<h3>New York City is one of the most famous cities in the world, and with that, 
					I want to see what it looks like to be surrounded by towering buildings. 
					I think going there will make me realize lots of things because it's just 
					a whole new world. The idea of seeing Times Square, the Brooklyn Bridge, 
					and the Statue of Liberty just feels like a dream, and I want to see these 
					attractive sights in my reality. </h3>
